# Meeting Log
## 24-06-2022

### Previous (complete/incomplete [ ] [x])
 - [x] Start working on the C++ port of the gvxr json reader (currently in python)
 - [x] Fix clas Diagrams
### Planned
- Actually make boost work properly (this is seriously slowing down the work now)
- Start work on a 'prototype' scene in unreal engine to begin building classes and testing out the user facing side of the application


### Notable Issues
- Boost JSON seems to be causing a few problems, see commit: https://github.com/Lewinator56/gvxrJson-cpp/commit/8c99082a169bd4ccbdacd9b84704ef0fa6b04e1e in https://github.com/Lewinator56/gvxrJson-cpp
