# Dev Log
## 19-08-2022
No meeting as Franck is on holiday!

### Previous 
 -  Finish xrayviewer application
     - Add log/gamma correction/linear processing to the output image
     - Save output image as raw to application directory
     - Update UI to reflect other changes (as stated above)
     - Optimised realtime rendering (discuss this in report)
     - Solved all of the linking errors
         - Recompiling glfw3 without the duplicate symbols worked
         - Turns out I was importing the zlib static library that linked to the dll, hence the requirement for the zlib dll
     - Test realtime renders and get feedback for mindor changes from other gvxr users. webCT has been useful for this
 -  Add engine choice and extensibility to project report
### Planned
- Add background section to report
    - X rays
    - Rendering 
        - raytracing (gvxr) 
        - rasterization (ue5)
    - gvxr
    - image processing (gamma correction and other enhancements)
- Add implementation section to report
    - Blueprint
        - Interfaces (interaction with engine parts)
        - Facade class for interaction with C++
        - Level design (scanner)
        - UI design
    - C++
        - Exposing methods to blueprint
        - Interfacing from ue5 to gvxr
        - gvxr library integration and requirements
        - Implementation limitations
        - Material struct and sample management
        - Generating the output image and the 'lazy' method of displaying a reference gradient that updates with the render
            - Check min/max corrected for processing type - possible improvements to help with speed
    - Issues
        - Inability to display the loaded mesh - limitation of unreal engine and far too much work to add now
        - Something not quite right with the log scale (might fix)
