# Dev Log
## 26-08-2022
Franck is back from holiday now!

### Planned
- Produce evaluation survey for validity testing the application.
- Add error checking for sample setup.
- Produce demonstration video.
- Produce presentation for second marker.
- Change implementation and desing section to 'Methods' and add a few more images to the background section.

### Previous
- Added background section to report
    - X rays
    - Rendering 
        - raytracing (gvxr) 
        - rasterization (ue5)
    - gvxr
    - lab-CT
- Added implementation section to report
    - Blueprint
        - Interfaces (interaction with engine parts)
        - Facade class for interaction with C++
        - Level design (scanner)
        - UI design
    - C++
        - Exposing methods to blueprint
        - Interfacing from ue5 to gvxr
        - gvxr library integration and requirements
        - Implementation limitations
        - Material struct and sample management
        - Generating the output image and the 'lazy' method of displaying a reference gradient that updates with the render
            - Check min/max corrected for processing type - possible improvements to help with speed
    - Issues
        - Inability to display the loaded mesh - limitation of unreal engine and far too much work to add now
        - Something not quite right with the log scale (might fix)
