# Meeting Log
## 05-08-2022

### Previous
- Recreate everything.
- interface between user and interactable parts of the program completed.
- added simpleGVXR to the project - likner error, but I think IO know what the issue is.
- Started exposing GVXR methods to the unreal engine frontend - need to expose these to blueprint.
- Half designed frontend for loading samples and materials - UE5 has a few annoying bits about file browsers etc... which makes selecting samples smewhat of a pain.
- Samples have a mixture which consists of 1 or more materials - struct or class for mixtures/materials.
### Planned
- Start writing the report!
- fix the linker error with simpleGVXR
- finish exposing methods for SimpleGVXR and run a test simulation.
